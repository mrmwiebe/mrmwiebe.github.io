Power Up Audio commissioned me to make a punchy graphics package for their advertising campaign during AGDQ

### Credits  

_Graphics_ - Marlon Wiebe  
_Edit/Audio_ - [Kevin Regamy/Power Up Audio](https://misfits-attic.com)  

### Making Of  

Duskers was a particularily tricky trailer to get just right and from the very start, I knew that it was going to be all in the audio edit so for this one I flexed my audio editing muscles.
