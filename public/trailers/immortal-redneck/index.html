<p>I knew when I was approached by the amazing folks at CremaGames that this was going to be a fun project.  Immortal Redneck is incredibly polished, has intense satisfying gameplay, and just looks amazing!  I knew that I just needed to keep things action packed and every shot should have some new content since there was just so much to work with.</p>
<p>Since there was so much content, I wanted the content to continue behind the text boards, so I used the free camera that they set up for me to capture long, smooth pushes down interesting corridors and rooms in the game.</p>
<p>Then I time-remapped it in AE to make it more impactful, added some text and lighting and voila you got yourself a gol dern text board! :)</p>
<p>Check out Immortal Redneck on Steam!  You won&rsquo;t regret it. :)</p>
