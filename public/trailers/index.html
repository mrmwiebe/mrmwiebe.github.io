<p>The main trailer above was the latest trailer I had done for the <a href="http://www.wherethewatertasteslikewine.com/">Where the Water Tastes like Wine</a> campaign.  It was involved a lot of animation work, experiementing with a stop-motion-y style, and I was pretty happy with the result.</p>

<p>Because of all the unique interactions between the environment and the characters in this game and the way they are shown in game, we knew that we wanted to let the game show off as much as possible and not try to overcomplicate the trailer.  I really wanted to avoid the trap of using too much text in a trailer, and that was possible as the devs made everything have great visual feedback to your actions.</p>

<h3 id="making-of">Making Of</h3>
<p>Since Jon had rigged up an IK rig for the player&rsquo;s in-game avatar, I knew I wanted to try and film everything inside game instead of doing mixed-reality.  This is something I&rsquo;d done to a small extent with an alternate version of my previous VR trailer HoloBall, and also something the Kert Gartner had done to great effect in his Space Pirate Trainer trailer.  I was also excited about this idea because it&rsquo;s SO MUCH EASIER OH MY GOD and still allows for tons of creativity.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go in-depth into the details of how to make mixed-reality trailers, there are a ton of blog posts already about that.  Check out <a href="http://www.kertgartner.com/making-mixed-reality-vr-trailers-and-videos/">this one by Kert Gartner</a>, this one <a href="http://northwaygames.com/how-to-mixed-reality/">by Colin Northway</a>, and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/358720/discussions/0/405694031549662100/">this Steam Community thread</a> about mixed reality.</p>

<p>I was immediately drawn to <a href="evanlovejoy.com" title="Evan Lovejoy">Evan Lovejoy&rsquo;s</a> intricate and bizarre art style when I first saw screenshots for the game and I knew that this was going to be an incredible project.  When I got my hands on a build of the game, it was strange in all the right ways.  The combat was satisfying and there was polish and a level of care in this project that is rare.  It&rsquo;s not hard to see that this is a passion project.</p>

<h3 id="making-of">Making Of</h3>
<p>When Drew Taylor from <a href="http://www.surpriseattackgames.com">Surprise Attack Games</a> sent me a copy of Orwell, I was immediately intrigued.  Think of it as Papers, Please gameplay where you are playing an NSA-esque surveillance state by harvesting information from publicly posted websites online.  It&rsquo;s unsettlingly accurate and nails the mood perfectly.  The concept for the trailer was ambitious and breaks my usual rule that trailers shouldn&rsquo;t be longer than a minute, but rules are made to be broken!  Especially for trippy endings like this one. :)</p>

<p>The guys at <a href="https://texel-raptor.itch.io">Texel Raptor</a>, Garret, Sebastian, and Gordon, are the best people to work with.  It seemed like every crazy idea that I had they went for.  Even when I suggested that we make 3 mini-trailers they were like, &ldquo;yeah that sounds good.&rdquo;  So, that&rsquo;s what we made.  3 x 30 second(ish) mini-trailers each with their own theme and showing off different aspects of the game.</p>

    <h2><a href="/trailers/ionic-video-link/">Ionic Video Link</a></h2>
    <p>Before making trailers fulltime, I made HTML things.  One of these things is a special video tag for the speedy hybrid app framework called <a href="getsoundmind.com">Ionic</a>.</p>
<p>I was making an app for a company in Winnipeg called <a href="ionicframework.com">Soundmind Health Technologies</a>.  In this particular app, I needed to be able to show a list of videos and when they were clicked, smoothly animate and fade into the video and have them start automatically.</p>
<p>So, I thought that this would be the best time to try out one of <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive" title="Angular Directives">Angular&rsquo;s directives</a>, which basically lets you make up your own HTML tags and wrap them with custom javascript and behaviors.

<p>Fuego is a really tough game to show off in a minute of gameplay.  At it&rsquo;s core, it&rsquo;s a turn-based game where both players are placing characters at the same time then watching how the standoff unfolds.  To introduce this concept to the player, the guys at Radiostatic suggested a pan down of a battlefield with slowly increasing intensity.</p>

<p>When Tim approached me with his game, I loved that the command console was a big part of the game.

I loved the idea, and Tim even made an animatic of it.</p>
