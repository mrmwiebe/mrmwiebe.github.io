<h3 id="making-of">Making Of</h3>
<p>This one was super fun.  When I was first talking with Andy Moore about the trailer, he suggested having two people playing the game as the main attraction of the game is sitting next to a friend.</p>
<p>Inspired by the visuals and Ben Lam&rsquo;s amazing soundtrack, I wanted it to have a fast cut and bright music video vibe.  What goes well with music videos?  Ring lights!</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have access to a ring light, but I knew a friend of mine Connor Bell had a programmable LED strips that glow and light up with color and I thought of just rolling it into a ring and holding it up to the actors faces to get a bright halo effect.</p>

<p>For the slo mo part with Allan getting knocked back, I used the slo mo function on my iPhone and captured him separately from Kailey and then composited them together in post.  Since the camera was recording at 23.976fps and the slo mo was capturing at 240fps, I was able to slow down the footage 10x!</p>
