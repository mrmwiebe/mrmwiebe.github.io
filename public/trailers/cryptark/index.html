  <h1>Cryptark</h1>
  <p>Derelict spaceships are floating through the galaxy ready to be stripped of scrap.  But it won&rsquo;t be easy.  You need to plan your assault, choose your weapons wisely, and don&rsquo;t waste your ammo!  It ain&rsquo;t cheap.</p>

<p>When I first played this game thinking about how to structure the trailer, it was immediately obvious to me that taking on one of these derelicts is akin to the heist in a heist movie.  So why not structure it like one?</p>
<p>The unique aspect of this dual-stick shooter was the initial plan phase where you planned out what systems you needed to take out.  That needed to be shown front and center, and I did so using some zooming in and out of the map and gameplay modes.</p>

<p>The rest of the edit followed easily enough, since Alien Trap already had VO actors, it was a simple matter of doing a scratch track, timing everything, then getting the real actress to read the lines.</p>
