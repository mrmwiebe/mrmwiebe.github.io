<h3 id="other-trailers">Other Trailers</h3>
<p>The main trailer above was the latest trailer I had done for the <a href="http://www.wherethewatertasteslikewine.com/">Where the Water Tastes like Wine</a> campaign.  It was involved a lot of animation work, experiementing with a stop-motion-y style, and I was pretty happy with the result.</p>
<p>I actually did a bunch of separate trailers for the campaign.  Here they are!</p>
<h4 id="sting-reveal-trailer">Sting Reveal Trailer</h4>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The goal with this one was mainly to reveal that Sting was going to be doing the voice over work for the Wolf.  It also involved a bunch of animation work and it was a ton of fun to work with.</p>
<h4 id="characters-trailer">Characters Trailer</h4>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another character trailer similar to the one above, but this one couldn&rsquo;t have the same impact with a reveal.  I really liked the song we chose for this one.</p>
<p>Where the Water Tastes like Wine is <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/447120/Where_the_Water_Tastes_Like_Wine/">releasing on Steam here</a>.  Go check it out!</p>
