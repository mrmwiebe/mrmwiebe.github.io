<p>Since Jon had rigged up an IK rig for the player&rsquo;s in-game avatar, I knew I wanted to try and film everything inside game instead of doing mixed-reality.  This is something I&rsquo;d done to a small extent with an alternate version of my previous VR trailer HoloBall, and also something the Kert Gartner had done to great effect in his Space Pirate Trainer trailer.  I was also excited about this idea because it&rsquo;s SO MUCH EASIER OH MY GOD and still allows for tons of creativity.</p>

<p>This meant that I was going to need to have custom controls from Jon in order to get the angles that I was hoping for.  After some testing and some back and forth, Jon implemented camera controls on the Vive&rsquo;s touchpads, the left for panning, the right for lateral movement.</p>

<p>One problem with this is that if I was to record it all myself, how was I supposed to move the camera while acting?  We solved this by adding a movement lock button that would keep the camera moving in whatever direction/pan it was on.  That way, I could set the camera to move and start acting while it was moving around me.</p>

<p>Jon was super quick with implementing these changes and once it was working, I was off and capturing epic shots of the amazing locations that Jon&rsquo;s made in the game and made sure to get some great shots of the epic BASS DROP. :)</p>

<p>Jon&rsquo;s added some awesome features in the game including tight integration with Twitch which looks super interesting and I&rsquo;m excited to see how it turns out.</p>
