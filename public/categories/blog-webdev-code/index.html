    <h2><a href="/trailers/ionic-video-link/">Ionic Video Link</a></h2>
    <p>Before making trailers fulltime, I made HTML things.  One of these things is a special video tag for the speedy hybrid app framework called <a href="getsoundmind.com">Ionic</a>.</p>
<p>I was making an app for a company in Winnipeg called <a href="ionicframework.com">Soundmind Health Technologies</a>.  In this particular app, I needed to be able to show a list of videos and when they were clicked, smoothly animate and fade into the video and have them start automatically.</p>
<p>So, I thought that this would be the best time to try out one of <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive" title="Angular Directives">Angular&rsquo;s directives</a>, which basically lets you make up your own HTML tags and wrap them with custom javascript and behaviors.  Very cool, but can be tricky to get your mind around how it all works.</p>
