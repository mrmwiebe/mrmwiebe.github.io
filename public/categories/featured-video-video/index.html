<p>I knew when I was approached by the amazing folks at CremaGames that this was going to be a fun project.  Immortal Redneck is incredibly polished, has intense satisfying gameplay, and just looks amazing!  I knew that I just needed to keep things action packed and every shot should have some new content since there was just so much to work with.</p>

<p>Because of all the unique interactions between the environment and the characters in this game and the way they are shown in game, we knew that we wanted to let the game show off as much as possible and not try to overcomplicate the trailer.  I really wanted to avoid the trap of using too much text in a trailer, and that was possible as the devs made everything have great visual feedback to your actions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go in-depth into the details of how to make mixed-reality trailers, there are a ton of blog posts already about that.  Check out <a href="http://www.kertgartner.com/making-mixed-reality-vr-trailers-and-videos/">this one by Kert Gartner</a>, this one <a href="http://northwaygames.com/how-to-mixed-reality/">by Colin Northway</a>, and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/358720/discussions/0/405694031549662100/">this Steam Community thread</a> about mixed reality.</p>

<p>I was immediately drawn to <a href="evanlovejoy.com" title="Evan Lovejoy">Evan Lovejoy&rsquo;s</a> intricate and bizarre art style when I first saw screenshots for the game and I knew that this was going to be an incredible project.  When I got my hands on a build of the game, it was strange in all the right ways.  The combat was satisfying and there was polish and a level of care in this project that is rare.  It&rsquo;s not hard to see that this is a passion project.</p>

    <p>Papers, Please meets the NSA surveillance state in Orwell.</p>

<h3 id="making-of">Making Of</h3>
<p>When Drew Taylor from <a href="http://www.surpriseattackgames.com">Surprise Attack Games</a> sent me a copy of Orwell, I was immediately intrigued.  Think of it as Papers, Please gameplay where you are playing an NSA-esque surveillance state by harvesting information from publicly posted websites online.  It&rsquo;s unsettlingly accurate and nails the mood perfectly.  The concept for the trailer was ambitious and breaks my usual rule that trailers shouldn&rsquo;t be longer than a minute, but rules are made to be broken!  Especially for trippy endings like this one. :)</p>

<p>Duskers was a particularily tricky trailer to get just right and from the very start, I knew that it was going to be all in the audio edit so for this one I flexed my audio editing muscles.</p>

    <h2><a href="/trailers/cryptark/">Cryptark</a></h2>
    <p>Derelict spaceships are floating through the galaxy ready to be stripped of scrap.  But it won&rsquo;t be easy.  You need to plan your assault, choose your weapons wisely, and don&rsquo;t waste your ammo!  It ain&rsquo;t cheap.</p>

<p>When I first played this game thinking about how to structure the trailer, it was immediately obvious to me that taking on one of these derelicts is akin to the heist in a heist movie.  So why not structure it like one?</p>
