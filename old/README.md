# Marlon Wiebe's Homepage

This is a GitHub Pages site that uses Jekyll and is a modified version of the Pixyll template.

I added video post functionality to Pixyll so that you can see the embedded video from the post loop and modified some of the typography.  I also added a portfolio homepage for my videos with a nice big header image.
