Black Future ‘88’s neon-lit retro-future style paints a dark alternate history of a world reeling from a nuclear cataclysm created by Duncan, the tower architect.

### Making Of

This game was just a joy to work on.  I love the aesthetic and music which makes it super easy to edit things to right away. :)

The intro animation was directed and animated by [Mads Broni](http://bndl.tv/portfolio/madsbroni/) and put together by the [Good Shepherd Games](http://goodshepherd.games) crew when I was brought on board to edit the gameplay portion of the trailer and compile everything together.

I used a new glitch effect for this trailer!  This time, instead of a plugin like one of my favourite name-your-price plugin [Dojo Glitch](http://creativedojo.net/store/dojo-glitch-script/), I used [this free pre-made After Effects project](https://www.rocketstock.com/free-after-effects-templates/digital-distortion/) template from Rocket Stock.  It has a ton more options, but the tricky bit about this is that you need to put everything you want to affect into a pre-made comp.  That means if you have different layers of things you would like to glitch, for me I wanted to apply glitches to the final edit and the logos/text separately, you need to re-import the entire template again to use it.  A minor nitpick, but since it has so many more options, it was worth it.

Thanks for reading! :)
