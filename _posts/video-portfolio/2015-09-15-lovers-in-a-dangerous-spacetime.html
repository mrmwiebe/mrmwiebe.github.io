<p>It was such an honour to work with Asteroid Base on this game. I&#8217;ve been a fan of <a href="http://www.matthammill.com/" title="Matt Hammill">Matt Hammill&#8217;s</a> work previous to LIADS, games like the graphical text adventure <a href="http://www.matthammill.com/games/guilded-youth/" title="Gilded Youth">Gilded Youth</a> and sneeze-and-sneak-em-up <a href="http://www.matthammill.com/games/gesundheit/" title="Gesundheit!">Gesundheit!</a> are fanastic games and they just ooze atmosphere.</p>

<p>One of the first things that Matt told me is that if there was any extra animation that he could do, he&#8217;d be all over that. </p>

<p>After deciding on the song and coming up with the structure for the trailer, I had one small but crucial chunk where the characters would be animated getting suited up for combat. I made an inital storyboard with my rough sketches, then he iterated on it, passed it back, and I polished it up! It was a fantastic and easy process.</p>
