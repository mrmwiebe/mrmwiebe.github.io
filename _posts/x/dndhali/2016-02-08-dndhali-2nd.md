Wherein the adventurers defeat a bugbear, kill a ton of goblins, save a captured human, and travel to a small mining settlement.

The adventurers, having failed to find a way to kill Klarg by climbing up the chimney chute, double back and try another route.  They scramble their way back up and around to the bridge where Finan was discovered by a goblin, and cross it, meeting a few goblins on the other side where they discover a pool of water and a former pool where the goblins had clearly triggered the flood earlier.

They dispatch the goblins and position themselves outside of Klarg's cave hoping to get the drop on them.  Tannis calls out to Klarg hoping to draw him out, but they hear nothing.  Douggie finally decides enough is enough and walks into the cave where he is promptly attacked by Klarg's wolf Ripper which attacks him and almost knocks him over.

An all out brawl ensues, with the characters running into the cave from their hiding spots attacking Klarg, his wolf Ripper and the two goblins there.  Klarg never even got to smack anyone with his giant morningstar before he went down.
