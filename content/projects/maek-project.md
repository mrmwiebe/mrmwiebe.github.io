I took part in the Global Game Jam 2016 and hung out with a bunch of awesome artists and game devs for 48 hours and made a rough, but functional game called "Maek Project".

## Making Of

Since the theme was Ritual, I wanted to make a WarioWare-esque game that looked at the daily ritual of trying to complete a project that keeps getting interrupted by real life responsibilities.

_Here's the whiteboard idea I came up with initially._{: .image-comment }

I'm also a big fan of silly physics-y games like QWOP and Off-Road Velociraptor Safari so it didn't take long to get the idea working.

_Delicious temp art!_{: .image-comment }

Using this temp art style, I whipped together a couple minigames, even made my own bitmap font and imported it using the fantastic free cross-platform program ShoeBox and the ShoeBox Unity Importer.

_Going for realism here. ;)_{: .image-comment }

This is pretty much the state in which I got to at the end of the Game Jam, but I've been slowly working on some actual graphics and a couple new distractions (what I'm calling the mini-games) like the USB one below.

You can play the Global Game Jam version right here.  Updated version to follow (hopefully).
