Burn every book.  Kill every author.  Purify the world for the God of Ignorance.

### Making Of

I was immediately drawn to [Evan Lovejoy's][d7b1c338] intricate and bizarre art style when I first saw screenshots for the game and I knew that this was going to be an incredible project.  When I got my hands on a build of the game, it was strange in all the right ways.  The combat was satisfying and there was polish and a level of care in this project that is rare.  It's not hard to see that this is a passion project.

Since Quote involves a lot of writing and such a unique premise, I knew that [Robin Lacey](https://twitter.com/robinlacey) and his team at [Vindit]([Vindit Co.](https://twitter.com/vinditco) was going to need to take the reigns for the concept and their incredible team of writers hashed out several ideas and with my input they whittled away at several scripts until we narrowed it to a super streamlined dialogue.

My favourite part about this trailer is how the intro and outro animations turned out.  It was a blast to take Evan's Photoshop files, split them up in After Effects, layer them, and add in various environmental effects.

I hope you enjoy it, and keep an eye out for the game when it releases next year!
