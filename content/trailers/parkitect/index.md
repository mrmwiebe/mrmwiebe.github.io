Watch all 3 silly mini-trailers I helped produce for this Rollercoaster Tycoon 1&2 spiritual successor!

### Making Of  

The guys at [Texel Raptor](https://texel-raptor.itch.io), Garret, Sebastian, and Gordon, are the best people to work with.  It seemed like every crazy idea that I had they went for.  Even when I suggested that we make 3 mini-trailers they were like, "yeah that sounds good."  So, that's what we made.  3 x 30 second(ish) mini-trailers each with their own theme and showing off different aspects of the game.

The grand overarching idea for the trailers was that it was to be making fun of the old 90s commercials for theme parks like Universal Studios with the super energetic voice over with a hard-sell of manufactured fun...but with our own twist!  It would be even more fun if things were a little off, as if we took the running of a virtual park as if it were real and the fake Executives of this park had ulterior motives for the unsuspecting patrons of the park.  So, I came up with Funtown City as a nice generic name for the park we were to advertise, and I was off to the script writing races!

#### BIG BROTHER  

{{< youtube rbohJtVLdR4 >}}

I get a weird feeling sometimes when playing sim games.  It's as if the player is some sort of omniscient being that is watching over everyone.

That's where the Big Brother premise came from.  Riffing on the idea that you can peer into the tiny lives of all these quote unquote happy park goers, and gather all this data that makes sense in a virtual context, but would be super creepy in real life.  Gordon came up with the genius idea of making the ending distored and weird

#### AMUSEMINEER  

{{< youtube RvAimjvBmZA >}}

Amusemineers is a riff on Disney's Imagineers and how everyone who plays the game is basically their own Amusemineer.  

In Funtown City however, they're not great, but the advertisers dutifully try to show their shortcomings as positively as they can.  Props to Gordon for the idea of holding on the Amusemineer title for just a little too long.  And dat cough he added...my favourite part of this vid. :)

#### EXTREME

YOU CAN BUILD CRAZY RIDES IN THIS GAME!  JOKES ABOUT BODILY FLUIDS!  IT'S SO EXTREME!  

ADRENALINE MEGALOPOLIS IS AN INSIDE JOKE ABOUT FUNTOWN CITY SO IT HAD TO COME LAST!

Overall, I was super happy with the response to these vids.  If you check out the comments in YouTube, they're 99% positive which is crazy for YouTube comments!
