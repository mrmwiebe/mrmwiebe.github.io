### Other Trailers

The main trailer above was the latest trailer I had done for the [Where the Water Tastes like Wine](http://www.wherethewatertasteslikewine.com/) campaign.  It was involved a lot of animation work, experiementing with a stop-motion-y style, and I was pretty happy with the result.

I actually did a bunch of separate trailers for the campaign.  Here they are!

#### Sting Reveal Trailer

The goal with this one was mainly to reveal that Sting was going to be doing the voice over work for the Wolf.  It also involved a bunch of animation work and it was a ton of fun to work with.

#### Characters Trailer

Another character trailer similar to the one above, but this one couldn't have the same impact with a reveal.  I really liked the song we chose for this one.
